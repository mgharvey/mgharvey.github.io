### Mike Harvey (Principal Investigator)
Mike is interested in the origins and maintenance of diversity at all taxonomic and geographic scales. He has been a birder most of his life, and fell in love with evolutionary biology in college. He also enjoys trail running, rock climbing, baking, and live music.
See his <a href="http://mgharvey.github.io/docs/Harvey_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> for more info.

### Oscar Johnson (Postdoctoral Fellow)
Oscar is an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow. He is building off his doctoral research on phylogenetics and the biogeography of speciation to study the macroevolutionary dynamics of avian migration and its impact on diversity. See his <a href="https://www.oscarjohnson.net/" target="_blank">website</a> for more info.
