### Mike Harvey (Principal Investigator)
Mike is interested in the origins and maintenance of diversity at all taxonomic and geographic scales. He has been a birder most of his life, and fell in love with evolutionary biology in college. He also enjoys trail running, rock climbing, baking, and live music.
See his <a href="http://mgharvey.github.io/docs/Harvey_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> for more info.

### Emily Johns (PhD Student)
Emily is a doctoral student in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology program. Her research focuses on understanding the impact of climate on avian migration over time and how climate change is projected to influence future migration patterns. She hopes that her work can improve conservation efforts and protect avian biodiversity. In her free time, she enjoys cooking, outdoor activities, and spending time with her cats.
